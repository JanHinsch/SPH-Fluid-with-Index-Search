# SPH-Fluid-with-Index-Search
A simple 2D SPH fluid solver with index search as an advanced neighbour search. A simple equation of state is used for the pressure calculation.

This project was done during a lab course at the University of Freiburg in a computer graphics course. The goal of this project was to implement a simple 2D fluid solver with an equation of state for pressure calculation.

For those who are interested, I also added my report which explains the general concept of fluid solvers as well as my implementation.
